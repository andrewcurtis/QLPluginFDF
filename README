FDF QuickLook PlugIn
==========================

Basic integration for Agilent/Varian .fdf files.
Creates quicklook plugins and thumbnail views


Many thanks to Laura Dickey for the open source BrushViewQL plugin that
provided an excellent template for this work.
(brushviewer.sourceforge.net).


Compilation
-----------

This has been tested only with Xcode v 4.0 and up on OSX v 10.6 and 10.7. 
Creates QLPluginFDF.qlgenerator

Installation
-------------

Copy QLPluginFDF.qlgenerator file into one of the following locations:

~/Library/QuickLook
 (access by the current user only)

or

/Library/QuickLook
 (systemwide -- you will probably need admin access to copy here)

 -- create the QuickLook subdirectory first if it does not exist.

The qlmanage service must be restarted before it can use the new plugin.
Do so either by logging out and back in, or running the following
command in terminal:

qlmanage -r 


Limitations
-----------

The window and level of images are fixed as a linear scaling between the
minimum and maximum image values.

Some issues may arise if you have any Adobe tools installed.  Adobe
provides an .fdf extension for some file types, and the qlmanage can
sometimes not recognize the difference.  If this happens try restarting
the service or logging out and in again.
